I am currently learning machine learning, and this repository presents the work I am carrying out as part of this learning process. It covers various aspects of machine learning, from data exploration and preprocessing to model development and performance evaluation.

The objective is to strengthen my theoretical foundations while developing practical skills through hands-on experimentation with real-world datasets.

I am a first-year student at ENSAE, with a strong interest in statistics and machine learning.
